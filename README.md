## Overview
You are a junior developer at Netflix. You’re on a team that is developing a list of movies for Netflix users called “Suggested for You.” Each time movies are added to Netflix, an algorithm determines a score of how likely a given user is to enjoy that movie.

Scores are integers between 0 and 100
No two movies will get the same score
It is your job to take new movies that have been scored, and store them in a Binary Search Tree.
